# Quick Look

# Authentications

This service utilizes token-based authentication, requiring users to have an account for accessing its features. If you don't have an account, please create a new one. Once registered, you can generate an authentication token. This token serves as a means of logging in, requiring you to authenticate yourself using your email and password. If the authentication is successful, you will receive an access token, enabling you to access the service. If the authentication fails, an error message will be displayed.

The provided tokens are the accessToken and refreshToken. The refreshToken is used for token refreshing purposes. The accessToken remains valid for one hour. To refresh the token, you must send the refreshToken to the service. If the refreshToken is valid, a new accessToken will be provided. If the refreshToken is invalid, an error message will be returned.

By following this authentication process, you can securely access the service and enjoy its functionalities.
